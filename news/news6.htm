        <h2>Imagine Learning Program Positively Impacts Utah’s K–3 Students</h2>
        <p>Provo, UT – April 5, 2016 – Imagine Learning,developer of award-winning language and literacy software for elementary students, recently reported positive data gleaned from a 2014–15 USOE/ETI efficacy study of educational software programs in Utah.</p>
        <p>Study data revealed that Imagine Learning showed positive treatment effects in 9 of 13 areas tested—more areas than any other program evaluated.</p>
        <p>In fact, Imagine Learning was one of only two programs to report positive effects in second grade.</p>
        <p>The American Educational Research Association emphasizes the importance of students who can read at grade level by third grade.</p>

        <p>By contrast, a lack of reading proficiency can cause devastating effects on students and eventually on Utah’s economy. To counteract future problems, the Utah legislature has proposed budget amendments to its current K–3 Early Intervention Reading Program.</p>
        <p>Current funding has allowed Imagine Learning and other K–3 vendors to reach a total of 54,000 students in Utah. Sustained funding will allow students to continue gaining critical reading proficiency by third grade.</p>
        <p>These ongoing funds ensure that Utah children receive both an engaging and a research-driven language/literacy curriculum in all schools statewide. Such funding also helps train educators so they can better use data within the program to drive further instruction.</p>
        <p>Imagine Learning usage fidelity continues to see usage improvements throughout Utah as educators work to obtain necessary technology in their classrooms. In order to promote usage and solve technology issues when they occur, Imagine Learning also offers on-site support to all partner schools.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Imagine Learning’s summer 2016 release will feature 36% more content than the last school year,including new activities focused on skills measured by DIBELS.</p>
        <p>“We’re pleased to see Imagine Learning’s great results within our own backyard,” said Joe Swenson, CEO of Imagine Learning. “These are our own kids, and they deserve the best educational experience we can offer.The USOE/ETI study just confirms what we’ve already seen in schools around the country.”</p>
