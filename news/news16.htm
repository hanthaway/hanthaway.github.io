                 <h2>Imagine Learning signs Student Privacy Pledge</h2>
                 <p>Imagine Learning announced today that it has joined a growing number of ed-tech companies that have made the Student Privacy Pledge to protect student data. The pledge identifies the important stewardship educational institutions and ed-tech companies hold in protecting student data and identifies several commitments regarding the collection, maintenance, and use of student personal information. Specific details on the pledge can be found at <a href="http://www.studentprivacypledge.org">www.studentprivacypledge.org</a>.</p>
                 <p>The Student Privacy Pledge was initiated by two student advocate groups—the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA)—and has gained national attention in recent weeks as President Barack Obama proposed a new Student Digital Privacy Act and encouraged more companies to sign the Student Privacy Pledge during an address at the Federal Trade Commission. This new focus is a necessary complement to the Obama administration’s push to expand broadband access for schools. As schools and districts increasingly adopt new digital tools to educate students, administrators and parents are grappling with a variety of student data concerns.</p>
                 <p>At Imagine Learning, protecting student privacy is nothing new. Bryan Sparks, chief technology officer, says Imagine Learning recognizes and respects its significant stewardship to safeguard student personal information. “We already protect student data, and we will continue to do so. This new pledge is a public way of uniting with other ed-tech companies to set an industry standard for the shared moral obligation we hold,” said Bryan.</p>
                 <p>Imagine Learning was the 100th company to sign the Student Privacy Pledge, which among other things includes statements about not selling student information, not using data to market products to children, and outlines standards for the way in which the data should be stored and transferred. As technology changes over time, Imagine Learning will move forward with a watchful eye, adjusting its privacy policy to preempt any potential security risks. “Making the pledge and declaring our commitment to protect student privacy and information security is an important part of building trust with students, parents, and schools,” said Bryan.</p>
                 <p>Imagine Learning is used by hundreds of thousands of students in 48 states nationwide, including a majority of the largest urban school districts, and in over 600 Utah schools by students in grades K–3 and English language learners. In addition to signing the Student Privacy Pledge, Imagine Learning has updated its corporate privacy policy—which is a more extensive outline of the way it collects, stores, uses, and protects student data—and includes information on how Imagine Learning meets and goes beyond the federal COPPA
        and FERPA requirements. To view Imagine Learning’s privacy policy, please visit <a href="http://www.imaginelearning.com">www.imaginelearning.com</a></p>
