              <h2>Study: students see 36-65% greater gains with Imagine Learning</h2>
         <p>SEG Measurement, an independent research firm, announced the completion of the first phase of a study of
nearly 1,000 English language learners in grades two–five in a large California school district. Study results
demonstrate that students in programs using Imagine Learning’s curriculum show greater improvement in
reading than students not exposed to Imagine Learning software.</p>
<p>The study compared growth in reading skills of students who used Imagine
Learning to comparable students who did not use Imagine Learning.
Students used the Imagine Learning software for approximately six months
between December 2012 and June 2013. Students in second grade using
Imagine Learning showed 36% greater gains in reading than students who
did not use the program. Imagine Learning students in grades three–five
showed 65% greater gains in reading than non-users.</p>
<p>“Students using Imagine Learning showed statistically significant gains in
reading skills and outperformed students who did not use Imagine Learning,”
said Scott Elliot, president of SEG Measurement. “These findings are
particularly important, given that students only used Imagine learning for half
of the school year. More extended use of Imagine Learning may yield even
greater gains for the students.”</p>
<p>Imagine Learning is an interactive language and literacy software
program that accelerates English learning. Focused on the five essential
components of reading—phonological awareness, phonics, fluency,
vocabulary, and comprehension—Imagine Learning software provides oral
language and academic vocabulary instruction for hundreds of thousands of students across the nation.</p>
<p>“We’re pleased that the results of this study confirm what we already knew,” said Marc Liebman, Chief
Academic Officer for Imagine Learning. “The data shows that Imagine Learning meets the direct needs of
English language learners and teachers for fostering reading skills.”</p>
<p>The study also gathered feedback from instructors. Teachers of students using Imagine Learning indicated that
they felt the software increased student motivation to learn, engaged students while working independently,
and provided differentiated instruction. The instructors found Imagine Learning to be particularly helpful in improving students’ skills in word recognition, reading fluency, and vocabulary. Read the original press release
