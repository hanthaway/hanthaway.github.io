         <h2>Imagine Learning honors exemplary schools</h2>
         <p>Provo, UT—September 11, 2014—Imagine Learning announced a list of outstanding and dedicated schools using the company’s award-winning language and literacy software. The top schools are being honored through Imagine Learning’s customer rewards program, Imagine Nation. Imagine Nation not only highlights schools that have demonstrated outstanding use of Imagine Learning, but also identifies and shares instructional best practices so that other schools can achieve the same level of success.</p>
         <p>A school must use the Imagine Learning software program regularly throughout the school year in order to qualify for one of four distinctions: World-Class School,Top 50 School, Super School, or Top 10 Percent School. In order for students to see maximum results, Imagine Learning recommends that they interact with Imagine Learning for at least twenty minutes a day.</p>
         <p>“Time and time again, we have seen Imagine Learning change lives as it builds confidence and improves student achievement,” said Joe Swenson, president and CEO of Imagine Learning. “And the surest way for students to realize those benefits is to use the program consistently. Our Imagine Nation schools are great examples of how to foster an atmosphere where kids are able to use Imagine Learning on a daily basis.”</p>
         <p>Students who regularly use Imagine Learning have shown impressive gains on high-stakes tests, including state English language development and language arts tests. Many schools recognized through the Imagine Nation program have implemented innovative practices like rearranging computer lab schedules or starting before or after school programs to achieve consistent use of Imagine Learning.</p>
         <p>“Schools that have qualified for the Imagine Nation program are elite Imagine Learning users,” said Chief Sales Officer Derrin Hill. “They have seen that Imagine Learning is imperative to student success, so they make software usage a priority. It is truly the best part of my job to see schools really embrace the program. It can be such a gift to students, and we love to see it used to its full potential.”</p>
         <p>Over the next month, qualifying schools will be awarded with plaques, trophies, banners, and classroom materials.
