                <h2>Glassdoor Selects Imagine Learning for Best Places to Work 2016</h2>
                 <p>PROVO, UT, DEC. 9, 2015 —Imagine Learning has been honored with a Glassdoor Employees’ Choice Award, recognizing the Best Places to Work in 2016 in the SMB category. The Employees’ Choice Awards program, now in its eighth year, relies solely on the input of employees, who elect to provide feedback on their jobs, work environments and companies via Glassdoor</p>
                 <p>This national Glassdoor honor comes several weeks after Imagine Learning received ‘best places to work’ honors from Deseret News and Utah Business Magazine.</p>
                 <p>“Imagine Learning is an incredible place to work,” said Joe Swenson, Imagine Learning CEO. “Our mission is to change the lives of children and open doors of opportunity, and our employees passionately follow that mission. Additionally, our company values direct us to work together unitedly as we help children learn. Each employee has the opportunity to do something significant, meaningful, and worthwhile every day. And we certainly have fun in the process!”</p>
                 <p>“Everyone wants a job and company they love,” said Glassdoor co-founder and CEO Robert Hohman. “At Glassdoor, we’re working to make that a reality for the millions of job seekers around the world who are turning to Glassdoor for information they can’t find anywhere else. Programs like the Employees’ Choice Awards allow us to honor employers that stand out for their efforts in providing an enjoyable work environment and culture.”</p>
                 <p>On Glassdoor, current and former employees of companies worldwide can share both quantitative and qualitative data about their workplace experience in a survey designed to capture a genuine and authentic inside look at what it’s like to work at particular jobs and companies. The survey asks employees to rate their satisfaction with the company overall, and key workplace factors like career opportunities, compensation,benefits, work/life balance, senior management, as well as culture and values. In addition, employees are asked to describe the best reasons to work at their companies as well as any downsides.</p>
                 <p>The Best Places to Work are determined using company reviews shared by U.S. based employees between November 3, 2014 and November 1, 2015. To be considered for the SMB category, a company must have less than 1,000 employees and have received at least 25 company reviews from U.S.-based employees during the window of eligibility. The final list is compiled based on Glassdoor’s proprietary algorithm, and takes into account quantity, quality and consistency of reviews.
